# Wizard News (Part 1)

### Context and Goals
We've seen how Node.js enables JavaScript to interact with the computer. Express helps our Node application respond to HTTP requests. Let's apply these tools to create something consumer-focused: a simple Reddit/Hacker news clone. This project will dive deep into Express features.

### We will build:
1. A homepage similar to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), that lists all posts.
2. A Details page, that shows the complete news content.
3. A form to send a new post (not right now, but in a separate workshop).

### Important note: 
Right now, there will be no persistent database in our application; we will simply be using a JavaScript array to hold objects in the server's RAM.
